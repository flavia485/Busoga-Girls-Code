    <h1>Our Tech Skills</h1>
    <p>We are building the future with code, creativity, and courage. Here's what we can do!</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Skills Intro -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>What We've Learned</h2>
    <p>Busoga Girls Code is not just a group; itâ€™s a team of learners, builders, and leaders. Weâ€™ve learned different skills in technology, and weâ€™re proud to share them with others. Below are the core tech areas we've focused on so far.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- HTML & CSS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>ðŸ’» Web Development (HTML & CSS)</h2>
    <p>We started our tech journey by learning how to build websites using HTML and CSS. These are the basic building blocks of the web. We use them to create beautiful, functional, and user-friendly websites. Some things weâ€™ve learned include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating structured web pages with HTML</li>
      <li>Styling pages using CSS (colors, layouts, fonts)</li>
      <li>Responsive design for phones and tablets</li>
      <li>Navigation bars, buttons, and forms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are using these skills to build this website and also to teach others how to make their own web pages.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Scratch -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>ðŸŽ® Scratch Programming</h2>
    <p>Scratch helped us understand the logic behind programming in a fun and visual way. Using drag-and-drop blocks, we learned how to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create animations and simple games</li>
      <li>Use loops, conditions, and variables</li>
      <li>Build interactive stories and quizzes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We use Scratch when teaching younger girls or beginners, as it builds confidence and creativity.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Robotics -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>ðŸ¤– Robotics</h2>
    <p>We explored basic robotics using kits like Arduino and LEGO Mindstorms. With these tools, we learned how to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Build simple robots using sensors and motors</li>
      <li>Write basic code to control robots</li>
      <li>Make robots respond to touch, light, and movement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Robotics taught us about teamwork, innovation, and how software and hardware work together.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Machine Learning -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>ðŸ§  Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>We were introduced to basic ideas in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Though still beginners, we learned about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What AI and machine learning are</li>
      <li>How data can be used to teach computers</li>
      <li>Using beginner-friendly tools to train simple models</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our goal is to go deeper into this field and help others understand how AI is changing the world.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- How We Use Our Skills -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>ðŸ“¢ How We Use Our Skills</h2>
    <p>We donâ€™t just learn â€” we use our skills to teach, build, and make a difference. Hereâ€™s how:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We create real websites for projects and awareness campaigns</li>
      <li>We organize tech workshops and coding camps for girls</li>
      <li>We build tech-based solutions to solve problems in our community</li>
      <li>We mentor others who are just starting in tech</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our dream is to help every girl see that she belongs in technology.</p>
