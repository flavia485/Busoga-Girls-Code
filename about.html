  <!-- Our Story -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Busoga Girls Code started with a simple idea: to give girls the chance to learn and grow through technology. In a world where technology is changing everything, we saw that many girls in our region were left behind. So we came together to learn, grow, and teach.</p>
    <p>We began by learning HTML and CSS for building websites. Then we moved on to fun tools like Scratch for games, robotics for creativity, and even beginner machine learning. We are proud to say that we now teach others what we have learned.</p>

  <!-- Our Team -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Meet Our Team</h2>
    <p>We are a team of bright and motivated girls from different backgrounds, united by a love for learning and technology. Each of us brings something special to the group—from design skills to public speaking, from coding to mentoring others.</p>
    <p>Our team believes in lifting each other up and sharing what we know. We are future developers, engineers, creators—and we’re just getting started.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why We Started -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Why We Started This Project</h2>
    <p>In many communities, girls are not encouraged to join the tech world. We started Busoga Girls Code to change that mindset. We wanted to show that girls are just as capable in coding, robotics, and digital problem solving.</p>
    <p>By creating this website, we want to prove that with opportunity, training, and support, girls can do anything—including leading the future of technology.</p>
  </section>
